# CleanSweepRob

**We are going to have three modules in this maven project**

* cleansweep-model: this module would contain all the necessary models of the project.
* cleansweep-service: this module would contain all the controllers which controls the interactions and business logic
* cleansweep-ui: this model would contain all the ui related classes mainly created by Java Swing framework

> The project could be run by using the "AppMain" class under cleansweep-service module.

**Agile Project management tool for this project could be found [here](https://trello.com/b/K4WMd96P/clean-sweep-robotic-vacuum-cleaner).
